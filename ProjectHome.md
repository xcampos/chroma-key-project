After an exhaustive search online, I have failed to find any open source projects working with Chroma-keying for Android devices. The aim of this project is to provide a useful Chroma-key library, that will make it easy to implement applications and games that can take pictures in front of a Green or Blue screen, and apply the pictures on a chosen background. Furthermore, the application will also allow the user to upload the picture using Intent.

You can download the source (which works with Eclipse) from the downloads page. I have added a small and very simple "game" as a test.
By default, the chromkey.java class uses the colour blue, but you can switch this to green in the actual class itself.

I have also added a custom sprite class, and background class. Enjoy, and remember to share any improvements you make with the rest of the community!

P.S. The canvas class is based on the Lunar Lander game, while the preview class was taken from Marko Gargenta's example on http://marakana.com/. Many thanks to the developers :)
